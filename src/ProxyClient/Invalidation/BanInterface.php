     * Ban URLs based on a regular expression for the URI, an optional
     * content type and optional limit to certain hosts.

     * '^(www\.)?(this|that)\.com$' or an array of exact host names, e.g.
     * ['example.com', 'other.net']. If the parameter is empty, all hosts
     * are matched.
     *
     * Examples:
     *
     * Ban all ``.png`` files on all application hosts::
     *
     *    $client->banPath('.*png$');
     *
     * To ban all HTML URLs that begin with ``/articles/``::
     *
     *    $client->banPath('/articles/.*', 'text/html');
     *
     * By default, URLs will be banned on all application hosts. You can limit
     * this by specifying a host header::
     *
     *    $client->banPath('*.png$', null, '^www.example.com$');
     *
     * @param string       $path        Regular expression pattern for URI to
     *                                  invalidate
     * @param string       $contentType Regular expression pattern for the content
     *                                  type to limit banning, for instance 'text'
     * @param array|string $hosts       Regular expression of a host name or list
     *                                  of exact host names to limit banning
     *
