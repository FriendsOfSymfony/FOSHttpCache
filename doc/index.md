FOSHttpCache
============

This is the documentation for the FOSHttpCache library. This library provides
a client to let applications do cache invalidation. It provides implementations
to talk to popular caching proxies.

If you are a Symfony user, have a look at the [FOSHttpCacheBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSHttpCacheBundle)
which integrates this library and provides a lot off additional features.

This documentation covers:

1. [Installation and Getting Started](installation.md) of the library
2. [Cache Invalidator](cache-invalidator.md)
   1. [HTTP proxy](http-proxy.md), the low level details
3. HTTP proxy configuration
   1. [Varnish](varnish.md)
4. [Testing](testing.md)
