.. _symfony httpcache configuration:

Symfony HttpCache Configuration
-------------------------------

Symfonyâ€™s `HttpKernel`_ component provides a reverse proxy implemented
completely in PHP, called `HttpCache`_. While it is certainly less efficient
than using Varnish or NGINX, it can still provide considerable performance
gains over an installation that is not cached at all. It can be useful for
running an application on shared hosting for instance.

You can use features of this library with the help of event listeners that act
on events of the ``HttpCache``. The Symfony ``HttpCache`` does not have an
event system, for this you need to use the trait ``EventDispatchingHttpCache``
provided by this library. The event listeners handle the requests from the
:doc:`cache invalidator <cache-invalidator>`.

.. note::

    Symfony ``HttpCache`` does not currently provide support for banning.

Using the trait
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    The trait is available since version 2.0.0. Version 1.* of this library
    instead provided a base ``HttpCache`` class to extend.

Your ``AppCache`` needs to implement ``CacheInvalidation`` and use the
trait ``FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\EventDispatchingHttpCache``::

    // app/AppCache.php

    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\CacheInvalidation;
    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\EventDispatchingHttpCache;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\HttpCache\HttpCache;

    class AppCache extends HttpCache implements CacheInvalidation
    {
        use EventDispatchingHttpCache;

        /**
         * Made public to allow event listeners to do refresh operations.
         *
         * {@inheritDoc}
         */
        public function fetch(Request $request, $catch = false)
        {
            return parent::fetch($request, $catch);
        }
    }

The trait adds the ``addSubscriber`` and ``addListener`` methods as defined in
the ``EventDispatcherInterface`` to your cache kernel. In addition, it triggers
events before and/or after kernel methods to let the listeners interact. If you
need to overwrite core ``HttpCache`` functionality in your kernel, you can
provide your own event listeners. If you need to implement functionality
directly on the methods, be careful to always call the trait methods rather
than going directly to the parent, or events will not be triggered anymore. You
might also need to copy a method from the trait and add your own logic between
the events to not be too early or too late for the event.

When starting to extend your ``AppCache``, it is recommended to use the
``EventDispatchingHttpCacheTestCase`` to run tests with your kernel to be sure
all events are triggered as expected.

.. note::

    If you use ``HttpKernel::loadClassCache`` from the console, you will need
    to add ``class_exists('FOS\\HttpCache\\SymfonyCache\\CacheEvent');`` right
    after the inclusion of ``bootstrap.php.cache`` in ``app/console``. For web
    requests, this is done automatically by the trait. If you miss to do so,
    you will get the following error:

    .. code-block:: bash

        Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\Event in app/cache/dev/classes.php on line ...

Cache event listeners
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you have an event dispatching kernel, you can make it register the
listeners you need. While you could do that from your bootstrap code, this is
not the recommended way. You would need to adjust every place you instantiate
the cache. Instead, overwrite the constructor of your ``AppCache`` and register
the listeners you need there::

    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\DebugListener();
    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\CustomTtlListener();
    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\PurgeListener;
    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\RefreshListener;
    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\UserContextListener;

    // ...

    /**
     * Overwrite constructor to register event listeners for FOSHttpCache.
     */
    public function __construct(
        HttpKernelInterface $kernel,
        StoreInterface $store,
        SurrogateInterface $surrogate = null,
        array $options = []
    ) {
        parent::__construct($kernel, $store, $surrogate, $options);

        $this->addSubscriber(new CustomTtlListener());
        $this->addSubscriber(new PurgeListener());
        $this->addSubscriber(new RefreshListener());
        $this->addSubscriber(new UserContextListener());
        if (isset($options['debug']) && $options['debug']) {
            $this->addSubscriber(new DebugListener());
        }
    }

The event listeners can be tweaked by passing options to the constructor. The
Symfony configuration system does not work here because things in the cache
happen before the configuration is loaded.

Purge
~~~~~

To support :ref:`cache invalidation <cache invalidate>`, register the
``PurgeListener``. If the default settings are right for you, you don't
need to do anything more.

Purging is only allowed from the same machine by default. To purge data from
other hosts, provide the IPs of the machines allowed to purge, or provide a
RequestMatcher that checks for an Authorization header or similar. *Only set
one of ``client_ips`` or ``client_matcher``*.


* **client_ips**: String with IP or array of IPs that are allowed to
  purge the cache.

  **default**: ``127.0.0.1``

* **client_matcher**: RequestMatcherInterface that only matches requests that are
  allowed to purge.

  **default**: ``null``

* **purge_method**: HTTP Method used with purge requests.

  **default**: ``PURGE``


Purge tags (cache invalidation using tags)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.1

    Support for tag invalidation in Symfony HttpCache has been added in
    version 2.1.


See :ref:`TaggableStore <taggablestore>` for extended description.

Purging tags is only allowed from the same machine by default.
You can configure the listener just the same as the `PurgeListener` plus the
`purge_tags_method` and `purge_tags_header`:

* **client_ips**: String with IP or array of IPs that are allowed to
  purge the cache.

  **default**: ``127.0.0.1``

* **client_matcher**: RequestMatcherInterface that only matches requests that are
  allowed to purge.

  **default**: ``null``

* **purge_tags_method**: HTTP Method used with purge tags requests.

  **default**: ``PURGETAGS``

* **purge_tags_header**: HTTP Header that contains the comma-separated tags to purge.

  **default**: ``X-Cache-Tags``

If you want support for tag based cache invalidation, you need to register both,
the ``PurgeListener`` and the ``TaggableStore`` so your ``AppCache`` should end
up looking like this::

    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\TaggableStore();
    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\PurgeTagsListener();

    // ...

    /**
     * Overwrite constructor to register the TaggableStore.
     */
    public function __construct(
        HttpKernelInterface $kernel,
        SurrogateInterface $surrogate = null,
        array $options = []
    ) {
        $store = new TaggableStore($kernel->getCacheDir());

        parent::__construct($kernel, $store, $surrogate, $options);

        $this->addSubscriber(new PurgeTagsListener());
    }


.. _taggablestore:

The TaggableStore
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 2.1

    The ``TaggableStore`` has been added in version 2.1.

.. warning::

    You need at least versions 3.4 of ``symfony/cache`` and ``symfony/lock``
    to use this feature! Add the following lines to your ``composer.json`` and run
    ``composer update``::

        "symfony/lock": "^3.4",
        "symfony/cache": "^3.4",


Symfony's ``HttpCache`` does not support tags based cache invalidation by default.
However, this library ships with a ``TaggableStore`` and a corresponding
``PurgeTagsListener`` which provide this functionality.
Even if you do not want to invalidate cache entries by tags, you might be
interested in using the ``TaggableStore`` instead of the default ``Store``
implementation Symfony ships with.

That's because ``TaggableStore`` also prunes expired entries on a regular basis
which is something the default ``Store`` does not. The default ``Store`` keeps
filling up your file system without ever cleaning up expired cache entries.
The ``TaggableStore`` counts all the cache write operations (so fetching items
from the cache is not slowed down) and after reaching a configurable
threshold (default ``500``), it prunes expired data. If you want to disable
pruning, you can set the option ``prune_threshold`` to ``0``.
This means that after every ``500`` HTTP cache writes, your file system directory
will be cleaned up and thus kept in good shape.
You can configure the prune threshold by providing a different threshold as
second argument to the constructor of ``TaggableStore``.

For this to work, you have to use the ``TaggableStore`` in your kernel::

    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\PurgeTagsListener();

    // ...

    /**
     * Overwrite constructor to register the TaggableStore.
     */
    public function __construct(
        HttpKernelInterface $kernel,
        SurrogateInterface $surrogate = null,
        array $options = []
    ) {
        $store = new TaggableStore($kernel->getCacheDir());

        parent::__construct($kernel, $store, $surrogate, $options);
    }

The ``TaggableStore`` can be configured by passing an array of ``$options`` as a
second argument:

* **prune_threshold**: Configure the number of write actions until the
  store will prune the expired cache entries. Pass 0 if you want to disable
  automated pruning.
  Type: int

* **purge_tags_header**: The HTTP header name used to check for tags
  Type: string

* **cache**: The cache adapter.
  Use this option if you want to use a different cache implementation than the
  default one.
  Note that there are very good reasons that the local adapters are used by
  default. This is to protect you as a developer! Only override it if you're
  really sure your cache implementation meets the needs of Symfony's HttpCache.
  Type: Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\TagAwareAdapterInterface

* **lock_factory**: The lock factory.
  Use this option if you want to use a different lock implementation than the
  default one.
  Note that there are very good reasons that the local adapters are used by
  default. This is to protect you as a developer! Only override it if you're
  really sure your lock implementation meets the needs of Symfony's HttpCache.
  Type: Symfony\Component\Lock\Factory

Refresh
~~~~~~~

To support :ref:`cache refresh <cache refresh>`, register the
``RefreshListener``. You can pass the constructor an option to specify
what clients are allowed to refresh cache entries. Refreshing is only allowed
from the same machine by default. To refresh from other hosts, provide the
IPs of the machines allowed to refresh, or provide a RequestMatcher that
checks for an Authorization header or similar. *Only set one of
``client_ips`` or ``client_matcher``*.

The refresh listener needs to access the ``HttpCache::fetch`` method which
is protected on the base HttpCache class. The ``EventDispatchingHttpCache``
exposes the method as public, but if you implement your own kernel, you need
to overwrite the method to make it public.

* **client_ips**: String with IP or array of IPs that are allowed to
  refresh the cache.

  **default**: ``127.0.0.1``

* **client_matcher**: RequestMatcher that only matches requests that are
  allowed to refresh.

  **default**: ``null``

.. _symfony-cache user context:

User Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support :doc:`user context hashing <user-context>` you need to register the
``UserContextListener``. The user context is then automatically recognized
based on session cookies or authorization headers. If the default settings are
right for you, you don't need to do anything more. You can customize a number of
options through the constructor:

* **anonymous_hash**: Hard-coded hash to use for anonymous users. This is a
  performance optimization to not do a backend request for users that are not
  logged in. If you specify a non-empty value for this field, that is used as
  context hash header instead of doing a hash lookup for anonymous users.

* **user_hash_accept_header**: Accept header value to be used to request the
  user hash to the backend application. Must match the setup of the backend
  application.

  **default**: ``application/vnd.fos.user-context-hash``

* **user_hash_header**: Name of the header the user context hash will be stored
  into. Must match the setup for the Vary header in the backend application.

  **default**: ``X-User-Context-Hash``

* **user_hash_uri**: Target URI used in the request for user context hash
  generation.

  **default**: ``/_fos_user_context_hash``

* **user_hash_method**: HTTP Method used with the hash lookup request for user
  context hash generation.

  **default**: ``GET``

* **session_name_prefix**: Prefix for session cookies. Must match your PHP session configuration.

  **default**: ``PHPSESSID``

.. warning::

    If you have a customized session name, it is **very important** that this
    constant matches it.
    Session IDs are indeed used as keys to cache the generated use context hash.

    Wrong session name will lead to unexpected results such as having the same
    user context hash for every users, or not having it cached at all, which
    hurts performance.

.. note::

    To use authorization headers for user context, you might have to add some server
    configuration to make these headers available to PHP.

    With Apache, you can do this for example in a ``.htaccess`` file::

        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

Cleaning the Cookie Header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the UserContextListener only sets the session cookie (according to
the ``session_name_prefix`` option) in the requests to the backend. If you need
a different behavior, overwrite ``UserContextListener::cleanupHashLookupRequest``
with your own logic.

.. _symfonycache_customttl:

Custom TTL
~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: includes/custom-ttl.rst

The ``CustomTtlListener`` looks at a specific header to determine the TTL,
preferring that over ``s-maxage``. The default header is ``X-Reverse-Proxy-TTL``
but you can customize that in the listener constructor::

    new CustomTtlListener('My-TTL-Header');

The custom header is removed before sending the response to the client.

.. _symfony-cache x-debugging:

Debugging
~~~~~~~~~

For the ``assertHit`` and ``assertMiss`` assertions to work, you need to add
debug information in your AppCache. When running the tests, create the cache
kernel with the option ``'debug' => true`` and add the ``DebugListener``.

The ``UNDETERMINED`` state should never happen. If it does, it means that
something went really wrong in the kernel. Have a look at ``X-Symfony-Cache``
and at the HTML body of the response.
