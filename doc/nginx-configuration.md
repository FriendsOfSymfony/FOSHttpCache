Nginx Configuration
===================

This chapter describes how to configure Nginx to work with the library.

* [Introduction](#introduction)
* [Purge](#purge)
* [Refresh](#refresh)

Introduction
------------

Below you will find detailed Nginx configuration recommendations for the
features provided by this library. The examples are tested with Nginx version
1.4.6. For a quick overview, you can also look at [the configuration that is
used for the libraryâ€™s functional tests] (../tests/Functional/Fixtures/nginx/fos.conf).

Purge
-----

Nginx does not support [purge requests](invalidation-introduction.md#purge) out
of the box. You can add cache purging functionality by installing the
[ngx_cache_purge](https://github.com/FRiCKLE/ngx_cache_purge) module.
For more information:

* see [this tutorial](http://mcnearney.net/blog/2010/2/28/compiling-nginx-cache-purging-support/)
  by Lance McNearney
* on Debian systems, you can run [install-nginx.sh](../tests/install-nginx.sh).

Please refer to the [ngx_cache_purge module documentation](https://github.com/FRiCKLE/ngx_cache_purge)
for more on configuring Nginx to support purge requests.

Refresh
-------

If you want to invalidate cached objects by [forcing a refresh](invalidation-introduction.md#refresh)
you have to use [proxy_cache_bypass](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpProxyModule#proxy_cache_bypass).

There are many ways to have a request bypass the cache. This library uses a
custom HTTP header named X-Refresh.
